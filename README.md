# 🌱 Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning  
## 📌 Introduction

Plant diseases are a major threat to global food security, causing significant crop losses and economic damage. Early detection is critical to mitigate these risks, but traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and often inaccurate.

This project leverages deep learning to automate plant disease detection using leaf images. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system can classify diseases with high accuracy, enabling farmers to take timely preventive measures.

Key Features:
✅ High Accuracy: Achieves over 85% test accuracy in disease classification.
✅ Scalable: Can be extended to support more plant species and diseases.
✅ User-Friendly: Simple interface for farmers and agronomists to upload and analyze images.
✅ Open-Source: Encourages collaboration for improving agricultural AI solutions.
